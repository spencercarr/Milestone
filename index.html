                    <p>
                        Club Swimming is a co-ed team with about 200 active members. We are part of College Club
                        Swimming (CCS) which is the collective organization that unifies college club swim programs
                        across the country.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We practice five days per week for an hour and a half and compete in meets in both the fall and
                        spring semesters. There are three meets per semester, two of those being "day" meets where we
                        travel to schools within Virginia and one overnight/weekend meet.
                    </p>

                    <p>We attend CCS Nationals in the spring semester every year.</p>

                    <h3>How to Join</h3>
                    <p>We do not hold tryouts nor do we make cuts.</p>
                    <p>
                        Our team functions as a year-round team, so you can technically join throughout the year. The
                        ideal time to join is at the beginning of the semester. We hold a fall information session,
                        where you can
                        learn all about the team. Beside the info session, you can come to practice and join the team
                        any day during
                        the week.

                    <h3>FAQS</h3>
                    <h4>Where and How Often Are Practices?</h4>
                    <p>
                        All practices are held in the University Recreation (UREC) Pool. We offer practices Monday
                        through
                        Friday

                        starting at 4 p.m. Our schedule varies per date and semester, so check the calendar tab to see
                        the
                        up to

                        date practice schedule.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How Many Meets Per Semester?</h4>
                    <p>
                        We attend multiple meets through out the season; Usually 2 to 3 in the fall and 3 to 4
                        in
                        the
                        spring. We also host our own home meet in the Spring and host an Invitational in the Fall. We
                        end
                        our season

                        at the East Coast Collegiate Swim & Dive Club National Championship hosted by Georgia Tech in
                        the
                        Spring.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How Does the Point System Work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        We function off a point system to make sure the most active members get the most benefits. We
                        give
                        points

                        for every practice attended, community service event, fundraiser, and other club sports' events
                        attendance.

                        This is most often used when attending a meet with a limit to how many swimmers we can bring.
