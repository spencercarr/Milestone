        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            Club Swimming is a co-ed team with about 120 active members. We are part of College Club Swimming (CCS) <br>
            which is the collective organization that unifies college club swim programs across the country. <br>
            <br>
            We regularly hold practices and compete in meets in both the fall and spring semesters. There are three <br>
            meets per semester, two of those being "day" meets where we travel to schools within Virginia and one <br>
            overnight/weekend meet. <br><br>

            We attend CCS Nationals in the spring semester every year.

        <h3>How to Join</h3>
        <p>We do not hold tryouts nor do we make cuts.</p>
        <p>
            We encourage anyone with or without swimming experience to attend our New Member Interest Meeting
            which <br>
            takes place soon after Student Organization Night in September. After this meeting, we will hold a
            week of <br>
            practices in which new members will practice together and get to meet some people before introducing
            them <br>
            into practicing with returning members.
        </p>
