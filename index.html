        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            Club Swimming is a co-ed team with about 200 active members. We are part of College Club Swimming (CCS) <br>
            which is the collective organization that unifies college club swim programs across the country. <br>
            <br>
            We practice five days per week for an hour and a half and compete in meets in both the fall and spring
            semesters. <br>
            There are three meets per semester, two of those being "day" meets where we travel to schools within
            Virginia and one <br>
            overnight/weekend meet. <br><br>

            We attend CCS Nationals in the spring semester every year.

        <h3>How to Join</h3>
        <p>We do not hold tryouts nor do we make cuts.</p>
        <p>
            Our team functions as a year-round team, so you can technically join throughout the year. The ideal time to
            <br>
            join is at the beginning of the semester. We hold a fall information session, where you can learn all about
            <br>
            the team. Beside the info session, you can come to practice and join the team any day during the week.

        <h3>FAQS</h3>
        <h4>Where and How Often Are Practices?</h4>
        <p>
            All practices are held in the University Recreation (UREC) Pool. We offer practices Monday through Friday <br>
            starting at 4 p.m. Our schedule varies per date and semester, so check the calendar tab to see the up to <br>
            date practice schedule.
        </p>
        <h4>How Many Meets Per Semester?</h4>
        <p>
            We attend multiple meets through out the season. We usually attend 2 to 3 in the fall and 3 to 4 in the <br>
            spring. We also host our own home meet in the Spring and host an Invitational in the Fall. We end our season <br>
            at the East Coast Collegiate Swim & Dive Club National Championship hosted by Georgia Tech in the Spring
        </p>
        <h4>How Does the Point System Work?</h4>
        <p>
            We function off a point system to make sure the most active members get the most benefits. We give points <br>
            for every practice attended, community service event, fundraiser, and other club sports' events attendance. <br>
            This is most often used when attending a meet with a cap on how many swimmers we can bring.
